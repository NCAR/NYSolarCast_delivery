This code was downloaded from the following site:

	http://www.arl.noaa.gov/ss/models/cmapf.html

and made into a separate module using RAP makefiles. 

The code is Version 2.0 of the cmapf library 
(Conformal Map Function).  Version 1.0 is called
cmapf and Version 2.0 is called dmapf.

The algorithms are described in an article, Conformal Map
Transformations for Meteorological Modelers, by Albion D. Taylor,
published in the February, 1997 issue of Computers and Geosciences 
(v23, no 1). 

See ruc40.cc in src/dmapf for an example of how to use the software in
conjuntion with the ruc40 model. See src/dmapf/README for
documentation on how to call the routines. It's specified in Fortran
but the translation to C is straightforward.
